Almost every smart phone is equipped with accelerometer, the device that measures acceleration of the phone in all the directions. It is most often used to identify the angle of the phone with respect to the direction of the gravity so that it can know a photo should be shown vertically or horizontally. It is also used in some apps for pedometers or for detecting the owner's activities such as walking and jogging. Although the data is usually not recorded, it measures acceleration every 0.03 seconds, which can generate 5MB of data in only 1 hour. Apparently it has a potential to be a great data source that contains a lot of information about the owner, not only walking or jogging but also who is the owner.


In this project, I use time series data recorded by a cell phone positioned in the chest pocket, and try to identify the owners from their walking activities using machine learning techniques. The main data source used in this short summary is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository, but I am planning to use data recorded by my families and friends in future as well as simulated datasets that mimics real walking activities.
